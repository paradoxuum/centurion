# Getting Started

**Commander** is a flexible and extensible command framework for roblox-ts that makes defining commands easy
and readable.

## Installation

Commander is not yet available through the npm registry.

To install it, you'll have to use the GitHub URL.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="npm" default>
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    npm install paradoxuum/commander
    ```
    </TabItem>
	<TabItem value="yarn">
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    yarn add https://github.com/paradoxuum/commander.git
    ```
    </TabItem>
	<TabItem value="pnpm">
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pnpm add paradoxuum/commander
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Starting Commander

Commander needs to be started **once** on the client and server.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="client" label="Client" default>
To start Commander on the client, you'll need to provide some extra options if you want to use
its user interface.

```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderClient.run(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        app: CommanderApp,
    },
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="server" label="Server">
```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    // Register commands or types here
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Registration

The way commands or types are registered is the same on the server and client.

```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    // Registering commands
    const commandContainer = script.Parent.commands;
    registry.registerCommandsIn(commandContainer)

    // Registering types
    // This method isn't limited to just types! This simply provides the regsitry
    // object to any ModuleScripts in the container that return a function.
    const typesContainer = script.Parent.types;
    registry.registerContainer(typesContainer);
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```

See the [Registration](/guides/registration.mdx) guide for more details on how these methods work.
