# Getting Started

**Commander** is a flexible and extensible command framework for roblox-ts that makes defining commands easy
and readable.

## Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" default>

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @rbxts/commander
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Yarn">
:::warning

Installing through `yarn` may cause errors due to the way dependencies are installed.

It is recommended to use `npm` instead to avoid any issues.

:::

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add @rbxts/commander
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">
:::warning

Installing through `pnpm` may cause errors due to the way dependencies are installed.

It is recommended to use `npm` instead to avoid any issues.

:::

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm add @rbxts/commander
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Starting Commander

Commander needs to be started **once** on the client and server.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="client" label="Client" default>
:::warning

When using React in development mode (`_G.__DEV__` set to true), you **must** set
`_G.__DEV__` to true **before importing** Commander.

:::

To start Commander on the client, you'll need to provide some extra options if you want to use
its user interface.

```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderClient.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        // The interface that will be used to interact with Commander
        // Commander comes with a default interface, but you can create your own
        interface: CommanderInterface(),

        // You can also customize the interface by providing options
        interface: CommanderInterface({
            position: new UDim2(),
            size: new UDim2(),
            ...
        })

        // The options below are optional

        // The default key is F2, but you can change it here
        activationKeys: [Enum.KeyCode.F2],

        // The maximum terminal and command history length, default length is 1000
        historyLength: 1000,

        // If you don't want to register built-in types, you can change this option
        // This is set to true by default
        registerBuiltInTypes: true,
    },
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="server" label="Server">
```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        // If you don't want to register built-in types, you can change this option
        // This is set to true by default.
        registerBuiltInTypes: true,
    },
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Registration

The way commands and types are registered is the same on the server and client.

```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    // Register commands by loading all command ModuleScripts under an Instance
    // You can also use this for types: ModuleScripts that export a function
    // will be called with the registry object, allowing you to do any
    // registration there.
    const commandContainer = script.Parent.commands;
    registry.register(commandContainer);

    // If you've already loaded the command ModuleScripts
    // (e.g. through Flamework.addPaths) you can register
    // them like this:
    registry.registerCommands();

    // Type objects are registered like this:
    registry.registerType(someType);
    registry.registerTypes(someOtherType, anotherType);
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```

See the [Registration](/guides/registration.mdx) guide for more details on how these methods work.
