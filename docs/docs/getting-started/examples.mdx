# Examples

These are some examples featuring Commander being used to define commands.

## Ban Command

This is a simple command featuring one argument. Keep in mind that the class containing
this command **must** be decorated with `@Commander` in order to be registered.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { BuiltInTypes, Command, CommandInteraction, Commander } from "@rbxts/commander";

@Commander()
class BanCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "ban",
        description: "Ban a player",
        arguments: [
            {
                name: "player",
                description: "Player to ban",
                type: BuiltInTypes.Player
            }
        ]
    })
    ban(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {
        if (player.UserId === 0) {
            interaction.error("You cannot ban this player!");
            return;
        }

        print(`${interaction.executor.Name} banned ${player.Name}!`);
        interaction.reply(`Successfully banned ${player.Name}.`);
    }
}
```

## Info Command

This is an example of a command that uses **groups**.

Groups are defined in the `@Commander` decorator. At the moment, only the root group may
have children, but this may be changed in the future.

A command can be assigned to a group using the `@Group` decorator.

```ts showLineNumbers
@Commander({
	groups: [
		{
			name: "info",
			description: "View info about a user or the server",
		},
		{
			name: "user",
			description: "View info about a user",
			root: "info",
		},
		{
			name: "server",
			description: "View info about the server",
			root: "info",
		},
	],

	// Global groups are groups assigned to all commands
	// defined in this class.
	globalGroups: ["info"],
})
class InfoCommand {
	// This command will be executable through "info user view" once registered!
	@Command({
		name: "view",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "Player to display information about",
				type: BuiltInTypes.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	@Group("user") // You can also define groups like this: @Group("info", "user")
	userView(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {
		interaction.reply(`<Random data about ${player.Name}...>`);
	}

	// This command can have the same name as the above command, because it
	// is grouped under "server" instead.
	// This command will be executable through "info server view" once registered!
	@Command({
		name: "view",
	})
	@Group("server")
	serverView(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		interaction.error("Not implemented!");
	}
}
```
