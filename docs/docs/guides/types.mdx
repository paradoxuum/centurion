# Types

## What are types?

**Types** are used to specify how text for an argument should be treated when executing a command.

The primary purpose of a type is to **transform** text into another value.
For example, a `Number` type would transform the provided text (`string`) into a `number`.

They also allow for extra functionality, such as providing **suggestions**.

## Creating types

In order to create a type, you should use `TypeBuilder`. This is a helper class to make
defining types easier.

`TypeBuilder` will create a `TypeOptions` for you, using the values you provide
to each method. This is what you will use to register the type.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { TransformResult, TypeBuilder } from "@rbxts/commander";
import { t } from "@rbxts/t";

const playerType = TypeBuilder.create<Player>("player")
	.validate(t.instanceOf("Player"))
	.transform((text, executor) => {
		if (text === "@me") {
			return TransformResult.ok(executor);
		}

		const player = Players.FindFirstChild(text);
		if (player === undefined || !classIs(player, "Player")) {
			return TransformResult.err("Player not found");
		}
		return TransformResult.ok(player);
	})
	.suggestions(() => Players.GetPlayers().map((player) => player.Name))
	.build();
```

The string you provide to `TypeBuilder.create` will be the name of the type. It may be useful to store
your type names in an enum or constant to make them more accessible -
see [CommanderType](https://github.com/paradoxuum/commander/blob/main/src/shared/builtin/types/index.ts)
for an example.

The `validate` method requires a type guard. You can use `@rbxts/t` for this, or you can define them manually.

The `transform` method must return a `TransformationResult`. To create one of these, you can use the
`TransformResult.ok` and `TransformResult.err` functions.

The `suggestions` method is optional and should return an array of strings.

### "Expensive" types

:::warning

Not specifying a type that has a slow transformation function as "expensive" may cause the interface to lag.

:::

Occasionally, you may want to create a type where the transformation function might take a long time
to execute. For example, a type that executes a web request to retrieve some data.

In this case, you can use the second parameter of `TypeBuilder.transform` to indicate that the transformation is expensive.

This will prevent the type's transform function from being executed in the interface. For non-expensive types,
this is done each time the user types an argument, in order to indicate if the argument is valid.


```ts showLineNumbers
// Expensive is set to "true" in the transform function, so the result
// of this transformation will not be shown in the interface
const expensiveType = TypeBuilder.create<string>("expensive")
	.validate(t.string)
	.transform((text) => {
		task.wait(3);
		return TransformResult.ok(text);
	}, true)
	.build();
```

## Using types

:::note
Your type must be [registered](/docs/guides/registration#types) in order to be used!
:::

Types are primarily used when defining arguments - they specify what type the argument requires.

Let's say you have a `kill` command that requires a `Player` argument:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { CommanderType } from "@rbxts/commander";

@Commander()
class KillCommand {
	@Command({
		name: "kill",
		description: "Kills a player",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "Player to kill",
				type: CommanderType.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	kill(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {
		const humanoid = player.Character?.FindFirstChildOfClass("Humanoid");
		if (humanoid === undefined) {
			interaction.error(`${player.Name} does not have a Humanoid`);
			return;
		}

		humanoid.Health = 0;
		interaction.reply(`Successfully killed ${player.Name}`);
	}
}
```

`CommanderType.Player` refers to
[the name of the type](https://github.com/paradoxuum/commander/blob/main/src/shared/builtin/types/index.ts).

## Registering types

Types need to be registered to be used.

See the [Registration](/guides/registration.mdx#types) guide to learn how types are registered.

## Summary

- Types are used to transform text into another value and provide suggestions.
- They can optionally provide suggestions.
- They should be defined using `TypeBuilder`.
- They should be [registered](/guides/registration.mdx#types) in order to be used.
