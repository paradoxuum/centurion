# Types

## What are types?

**Types** are used to define how an argument should treat text when executing a command.

The primary purpose of a type is to **transform** text into another value.
For example, a `Number` type would transform the provided text (`string`) into a `number`.

They also allow for extra functionality, such as providing **suggestions**.

## Creating types

In order to create a type, you should use `TypeBuilder`. This is a helper class to make
defining types easier.

`TypeBuilder` will create a `TypeOptions` for you, using the values you provide
to each method. This is what you will use to register the type.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { TransformResult, TypeBuilder } from "@rbxts/commander";
import { t } from "@rbxts/t";

const playerType = TypeBuilder.create<Player>("player")
	.validate(t.instanceOf("Player"))
	.transform((text) => {
		const player = Players.FindFirstChild(text);
		if (player === undefined || !classIs(player, "Player")) {
			return TransformResult.err("Player not found");
		}
		return TransformResult.ok(player);
	})
	.suggestions(() => Players.GetPlayers().map((player) => player.Name))
	.build();
```

The string you provide to `TypeBuilder.create` will be the name of the type. It may be useful to store
your type names in an enum or constant to make them more accessible -
see [BuiltInTypes](https://github.com/paradoxuum/commander/blob/main/src/shared/builtin/types/index.ts)
for an example.

The `validate` method requires a type guard. `@rbxts/t` is preferable for
creating type guards as it's easy to use, but you can also define it manually if you want.

The `transform` method must return a `Result`. To create a `Result`, you can use the
`TransformResult.ok` and `TransformResult.err` functions.

The `suggestions` method is optional and should return an array of strings.


## Registering types

Types need to be registered to be used.

See the [Registration](/guides/registration.mdx#registering-types) guide to learn how types are registered.

## Summary

- Types transform text into another value.
- They can optionally provide suggestions.
- They should be created using `TypeBuilder`.
- They should be [registered](/guides/registration.mdx#registering-types) in order to be used.
