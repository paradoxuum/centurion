# Registration

:::warning
Commands and types can only be registered when starting Commander.

An error will be thrown if you attempt registration after it has been started.
:::

[Commands](commands.mdx) and [Types](types.mdx) must be registered in order to be used.

You can only register commands and types in the callback you provide when starting Commander:
`CommanderServer.start` and `CommanderClient.start`.

## Registering commands

In order to register commands, you must use the `registerCommandsIn` method.

This searches for all children that are a `ModuleScript` in the provided `Instance`. These will then be
loaded and any methods that have the `@Command` decorator will be registered. Commands will only be registered
if their parent class has the `@Commander` decorator.

```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    const commandContainer = script.Parent.commands;
    registry.registerCommandsIn(commandContainer)
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```

## Registering types

Types should be registered using the `registerContainer` method.

This searches for all children that are a `ModuleScript` and export a function in the provided `Instance`.

If any ModuleScripts that export a function are found, the function will be called with the registry.

```ts showLineNumbers
export = (registry: BaseRegistry) => {
    registry.registerType(someType)

    // You can also register multiple types at once
    register.registerTypes(someOtherType, yetAnotherType)

    // You can register commands here as well, if you want!
    const commandContainer = script.Parent.commands;
    register.registerCommandsIn(commandContainer)
}
```

## Summary

- Commands are registered using `registerCommandsIn`
- Types are registered using `registerContainer`
