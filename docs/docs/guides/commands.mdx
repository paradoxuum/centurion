# Commands

:::warning

To avoid confusing bugs or errors, make sure to look at [type safety](#type-safety)!

:::

## What are commands?

Commands are functions that players can execute. They're defined by their **name** and **group** and can
have **arguments**.

A command does not necessarily have to belong to a **group**. Groups are simply a way to organize
your commands, effectively turning them into subcommands.

If the command has arguments, the player's text input may be **transformed** into a new value, which is then
passed to the command function. The argument's **type** handles this transformation.

## Defining commands

Commands are defined using **decorators**.

There are three decorators that you'll likely use the most:

-   `@Commander` - Classes containing commands **must** be decorated with this to be registered
-   `@Command` - This is used to define commands
-   `@Group` - This is used to assign a command to a group

A command can be defined as follows:

```ts showLineNumbers
@Commander()
class EchoCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "echo",
        description: "Displays text",
        arguments: [
            {
                name: "text",
                description: "The text to display",
                type: BuiltInTypes.String,
            },
        ],
    })
    echo(interaction: CommandInteraction, text: string) {
        interaction.reply(text);
    }
}
```

## Command interactions

Each command is passed a `CommandInteraction` as its first argument. A `CommandInteraction` contains data
such as the `Player` who executed the command and the text used to execute the command.

You can access the interaction's data like so:

```ts showLineNumbers
@Command({ name: "printInteraction" })
printInteraction(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    print(`${interaction.executor.Name} executed: ${interaction.text}`);
}
```

It also allows you to send a reply to the executor of the command, like so:

```ts showLineNumbers
@Command({ name: "hello" })
hello(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    // You can use rich text here!
    interaction.reply(`Hello, ${interaction.executor.Name}!`);
}

@Command({ name: "error" })
errorMessage(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    interaction.error("An <b>error</b> occurred.");
}
```

## Command groups

Groups are simply a way to organize your commands. Any command assigned under a group
will effectively become a subcommand.

Groups must be defined in the `@Commander` decorator in order to be used.

You can use the `@Group` decorator to assign a command to a group.

For example, let's say you want to organize `view` and `delete` commands under a
`profile` group:

```ts showLineNumbers
@Commander({
	groups: [
		{
			name: "profile",
			description: "Profile commands",
		},
	],
})
class ProfileCommand {
	@Command({
		name: "view",
		description: "Views a player's profile",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "The player",
				type: BuiltInTypes.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	@Group("profile")
	view(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}

	@Command({
		name: "delete",
		description: "Deletes a player's profile",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "The player",
				type: BuiltInTypes.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	@Group("profile")
	delete(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}
}
```

You can also add **global groups**, which are assigned to all commands in the class:

```ts showLineNumbers
@Commander({
	groups: [
		{
			name: "profile",
			description: "Profile commands",
		},
	],

	globalGroups: ["profile"],
})
```

### Nested groups

Each **root** group can have child group(s).

A **root** group is any group that does not have a parent group; it is top-level.
This limitation means that groups can have at most **two layers** of nesting. This may be changed
in the future.

To define a group as a child of another group, you specify its name using the `root` key:

```ts showLineNumbers
@Commander({
	groups: [
		{
			name: "info",
			description: "View info about a user or the server",
		},
		{
			name: "user",
			description: "View info about a user",
			root: "info",
		},
		{
			name: "server",
			description: "View info about the server",
			root: "info",
		},
	],
})
class InfoCommand {
	@Command({
		name: "view",
        description: "View information about a player",
		arguments: [{ name: "player", description: "Player to view information for", type: BuiltInTypes.Player }],
	})
	// If info was a global group, you could do @Group("user") here
    // highlight-next-line
	@Group("info", "user")
	userView(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}

	@Command({
		name: "view",
        description: "View information about the server",
	})
	@Group("info", "server")
	serverView(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}
}
```

## Registering commands

Commands need to be registered to be used.

See the [Registration](/docs/guides/registration.mdx#registering-commands) to learn how commands are registered.

## Type safety

Type safety can only be provided if the types for your arguments match your parameters' types.

It's worth keeping in mind that **no warning or error will be displayed** for argument
and parameter types that do not match. To avoid confusing bugs or errors, you should exercise
caution when defining command arguments and ensure they have the correct type.

For example, the following code would **not** be type-safe - the argument types and parameter types don't match!

```ts showLineNumbers
@Command({
    name: "echo",
    description: "Displays text",
    arguments: [
        {
            name: "text",
            description: "The text to display",
            // highlight-next-line
            type: BuiltInTypes.String, // We're requiring a string for this argument...
        },
    ],
})
// error-next-line
echo(interaction: CommandInteraction, text: number) {} // But we're requiring a number here!
```

In order to assert that the argument and parameter types are equal, we would need a way to
retrieve each parameter's type. Unfortunately, this is not possible without using a TypeScript transformer.
There are no plans to implement this currently, as it would require manual configuration and
add a significant maintenance cost to the project.

## Summary

-   **Commands** are functions executed by players, defined by their name and group.
-   All classes containing commands must be decorated with the `@Commander` decorator.
-   Commands are defined using the `@Command` decorator.
-   You can **group** commands with the `@Group` decorator.
-   **Type safety** is only provided if the argument and parameter types match.
