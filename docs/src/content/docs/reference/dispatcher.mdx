## ServerDispatcher

### `run(path, executor, text)`

Executes a command.

**Parameters**:
- `path` - The command's path
- `args` - The arguments to pass to the command
- `executor` - The command's executor, or `undefined` if the executor is the server

**Returns**:
A `Promise` that resolves when the command has been executed. The value contained in the Promise is
a `CommandContext` instance containing the execution result.

## ClientDispatcher

### `run(path, text)`

Executes a command.

If the path points to a server command, the command will be executed on the server.

If `runAsPlayer` is set to `false`, the command will be executed with no executor. This only
applies to commands registered on the client - commands registered on the server will always
execute with the local player as the executor.

**Parameters**:
- `path` - The command's path
- `args` - The arguments to pass to the command
- `runAsPlayer` - Whether to run the command as the local player.

**Returns**:
A `Promise` that resolves when the command has been executed. The value contained in the Promise is
a `HistoryEntry` object containing the command's response and the time it was executed.
