To register a `TypeObject`, you can use the `registerType` or `registerTypes` methods.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
// You can register a single type like this
registry.registerType(someType);

// You can also register multiple types at once!
registry.registerTypes(someType, someOtherType);
`}/>

Similar to commands, you can also organize your types into modules.

One caveat here is that you currently cannot use something like `Flamework.addPaths`
to load type modules and register them. Instead, you must pass the instance
containing the type modules to the `register` method.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
import { BaseRegistry } from "@rbxts/commander";

// ...

export = (registry: BaseRegistry) => {
    registry.registerTypes(someType, someOtherType);
};
`} />

<Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    registry.register(script.Parent.types)
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
`} />
