To register commands, you must use the `register` method provided by the registry.

This will load all child `ModuleScript` in the provided Instance.

Any methods that are decorated with `@Command` will be registered,
as long as its parent class is decorated with @Commander.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    registry.register(script.Parent.commands);
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
`} />

If you're using another method to load modules (such as Flamework's `addPaths`),
you can use `registerCommands` to register them instead.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
Flamework.addPaths("src/server/commands");

CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    registry.registerCommands();
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
`} />
