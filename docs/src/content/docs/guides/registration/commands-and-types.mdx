If your commands and types are organized into ModuleScripts, they should be registered
through the [register](/reference/registry#register) method.

To be registered, they need to be loaded first. This can be done through the
[load](/reference/registry#loadcontainer-descendants) method,
which will require all child ModuleScripts in the container, or a similar method
such as `addPaths`,
provided by [Flamework](https://flamework.fireboltofdeath.dev/).

For commands to be registered, the parent class must be decorated with [@Register](/reference/decorators#register).

For types, you have two options:
- Mark the type for registration with [markForRegistration](/reference/types#markforregistration). The type
will be registered when the [register](/reference/registry#register) method is called, similar to commands.
- Export a function from the module (`export = (registry: BaseRegistry) => { ... }`) and register the type
manually using [registerType](/reference/registry#registertypetypes). One caveat here is that you must use
the [load](/reference/registry#loadcontainer-descendants) method for the exported function to be called.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
const types = ReplicatedStorage.types;

CenturionServer.start((registry) => {
    // Load command/type modules
    registry.load(script.Parent.commands);
    registry.load(types);

    // Register commands and types
    registry.register();
}).catch((err) => warn("Centurion could not be started:", tostring(err)));
`} />

Types can also be registered manually through the
[registerType](/reference/registry#registertypetypes) method.

## Registry synchronization

Commands registered on the server will be synced to the client. You can filter
commands by providing a callback to the `filter` option.

Types are **not** synchronized as functions cannot be sent across the network, so you will
have to register them on both the server and client. Due to this limitation, it is recommended
to store your types in a shared folder you can easily load from both sides.
