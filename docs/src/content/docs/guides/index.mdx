Commander is a flexible and extensible command framework for roblox-ts that
makes defining commands easy and readable.

## Starting Commander

Commander needs to be started **once** on the client and server.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Client">
        <Aside type="caution" title="Usage with React">
            When using React in development mode (`_G.__DEV__` set to true),
            you must set `_G.__DEV__` to true **before importing** Commander.
        </Aside>

        <Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderClient.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        interface: CommanderInterface({
            // You can configure the interface here, such as changing activation keys
        }),

        // The options below are optional

        // The maximum terminal and command history length, default length is 1000
        historyLength: 1000,

        // If you don't want to register built-in types, you can change this option
        // This is set to true by default
        registerBuiltInTypes: true,
    },
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
        `} />
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Server">
        <Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderServer.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        // If you don't want to register built-in types, you can change this option
        // This is set to true by default.
        registerBuiltInTypes: true,
    },
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
        `} />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Registration

<Aside>
Command modules should be loaded from within the start callback to avoid registration errors.
</Aside>

The way commands and types are registered is the same on the server and client.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    // Load all child ModuleScripts under the given Instance
    const commandContainer = script.Parent.commands;
    registry.load(commandContainer);

    const typeContainer = ReplicatedStorage.types;
    registry.load(typeContainer);

    // To register the loaded commands and types, you then call the register method:
    registry.register();
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
`} />
