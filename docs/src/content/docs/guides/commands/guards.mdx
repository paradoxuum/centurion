If a response is sent in a guard (through reply or error), the command will not be executed.

A command guard is simply a function that can be used to determine if a command
should be executed.

Guards can be assigned in three ways:
- At the class-level, which assigns the guard to all commands in the class.
  Guards assigned at the class-level will be executed before method-level guards.
- At the method-level, which assigns the guard to a single command.
- Through the `guards` option when starting Commander, which assigns the guard
to all commands.

A guard function is passed the same `CommandContext` that will be passed to the command.
You can use this to access data such as the command path or executor, and you
can send a reply using its `reply` and `error` methods.

A guard function should return a `boolean` - `true` if the command should be executed,
`false` if not.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
const isAdmin: CommandGuard = (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.executor.UserId !== 1) {
        ctx.error("Insufficient permission!");
        return false;
    }

    return true;
};

@Commander
class KickCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "kick",
        description: "Kick a player",
        arguments: [
            {
                name: "player",
                description: "Player to kick",
                type: CommanderType.Player
            }
        ]
    })
    @Guard(isAdmin)
    kick(ctx: CommandContext, player: Player) {
		player.Kick("You have been kicked from the server.");
        ctx.reply(\`Successfully kicked \${player.Name}\`);
    }
}
`} />
