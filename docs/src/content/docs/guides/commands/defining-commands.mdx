Commands are defined using [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html).

Centurion has four decorators:

- `@Centurion` - Classes containing commands must be decorated with this to be registered
- `@Command` - Used to define commands
- `@Group` - Used to assign groups to a command
- `@Guard` - Used to assign guards to a command

A command can be defined like so:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Centurion
class EchoCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "echo",
        description: "Displays text",
        arguments: [
            {
                name: "text",
                description: "The text to display",
                type: CenturionType.String,
            },
        ],
    })
    echo(ctx: CommandContext, text: string) {
        ctx.reply(text);
    }
}
`} />

## Command context

Each command is passed a `CommandContext` as its first argument.

The primary purpose of a `CommandContext` is to send a **response** back
to the command executor.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Command({ name: "hello" })
hello(ctx: CommandContext) {
    ctx.reply(\`Hello, \${ctx.executor.Name}!\`);
}

@Command({ name: "error" })
errorMessage(ctx: CommandContext) {
    // The default interface supports rich text, so it can be used here
    ctx.error("An <b>error</b> occurred.");
}
`} />

It also contains data such as the command **executor**
and the **text** used to execute the command.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Command({ name: "echo" })
echo(ctx: CommandContext) {
    print(\`\${ctx.executor.Name} executed: \${ctx.text}\`);
}
`} />

## Type safety

Type safety can only be provided if the types for your arguments match your parameters' types.

It's worth keeping in mind that **no warning or error** will be
displayed for argument and parameter types that do not match.

To avoid confusing bugs or errors, you should exercise caution when defining
command arguments and ensure they have the correct type.

For example, the following code would **not** be type-safe - the argument types and
parameter types don't match!

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Command({
    name: "echo",
    description: "Displays text",
    arguments: [
        {
            name: "text",
            description: "The text to display",
            type: CenturionType.String, // We're requesting a string for this argument...
        },
    ],
})
echo(ctx: CommandContext, text: number) {} // But we're expecting a number here!
`} />

In order to assert that the argument and parameter types are equal,
we would need a way to retrieve each parameter's type.
Unfortunately, this is not possible without using a TypeScript transformer.
There are no plans to implement this currently, as it would require manual configuration
and add a significant maintenance cost to the project.
