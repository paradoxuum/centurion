Groups are a way to organize your commands, effectively turning them into subcommands.

To assign groups, you need to register them first.
You can then use the `@Group` decorator to assign a command to a group.

You can assign groups in two ways:
- At the class-level, which assigns the group to all commands in the class.
- At the method-level, which assigns the group to a single command.

For example, let's say you want to organize view and delete commands under a profile group:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Register
// Assigning a group at the class level assigns the group to all
// commands in the class.
// You can also do this at the method level, but it's recommended to do it this
// way if all commands have the same group to reduce repetition.
@Group("profile")
class ProfileCommand {
	@Command({
		name: "view",
		description: "Views a player's profile",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "The player",
				type: CenturionType.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	view(ctx: CommandContext, player: Player) {}

	@Command({
		name: "delete",
		description: "Deletes a player's profile",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "The player",
				type: CenturionType.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	delete(ctx: CommandContext, player: Player) {}
}
`} />

## Nested groups

Groups at the top level can have child group(s), whereas groups that have a parent
cannot have child groups. This limitation means the maximum nesting level is 2, as of now.

To define a group as a child of another group, you specify its name using the root key:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Register
@Group("info")
class InfoCommand {
	@Command({
		name: "view",
		description: "View information about a player",
		arguments: [{ name: "player", description: "Player to view information for", type: CenturionType.Player }],
	})
	// If info was a global group, you could do @Group("user") here
	@Group("user")
	userView(ctx: CommandContext, player: Player) {}

	@Command({
		name: "view",
		description: "View information about the server",
	})
	@Group("server")
	serverView(ctx: CommandContext, player: Player) {}
}
`} />
