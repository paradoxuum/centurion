Types are primarily used when defining arguments - they specify what type the argument
requires.

Let's say you have a kill command that requires a Player argument:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
import { CommanderType } from "@rbxts/commander";

@Commander()
class KillCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "kill",
        description: "Kills a player",
        arguments: [
            {
                name: "player",
                description: "Player to kill",
                type: CommanderType.Player, // Specify the name of the type here
            },
        ],
    })
    kill(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {
        const humanoid = player.Character?.FindFirstChildOfClass("Humanoid");
        if (humanoid === undefined) {
            interaction.error(\`\${player.Name} does not have a Humanoid\`);
            return;
        }

        humanoid.Health = 0;
        interaction.reply(\`Successfully killed \${player.Name}\`);
    }
}
`} />
