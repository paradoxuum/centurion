Types are used to specify how text for an argument should be treated when executing a command.

The primary purpose of a type is to transform text into another value.
For example, a `Number` type would transform the provided text (`string`) into a `number`.

They also provide the ability to provide suggestions to the player when they're
typing out a command.
