Commander is a flexible and extensible command framework for roblox-ts that
makes defining commands easy and readable.

## Starting Commander

Commander needs to be started **once** on the client and server.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Client">
        <Aside type="caution" title="Usage with React">
            When using React in development mode (`_G.__DEV__` set to true),
            you must set `_G.__DEV__` to true **before importing** Commander.
        </Aside>

        <Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderClient.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        interface: CommanderInterface({
            // You can configure the interface here, such as changing activation keys
        }),

        // The options below are optional

        // The maximum terminal and command history length, default length is 1000
        historyLength: 1000,

        // If you don't want to register built-in types, you can change this option
        // This is set to true by default
        registerBuiltInTypes: true,
    },
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
        `} />
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Server">
        <Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderServer.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        // If you don't want to register built-in types, you can change this option
        // This is set to true by default.
        registerBuiltInTypes: true,
    },
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
        `} />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Registration

The way commands and types are registered is the same on the server and client.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    // Register commands by loading all command ModuleScripts under an Instance
    // You can also use this for types: ModuleScripts that export a function
    // will be called with the registry object, allowing you to do any
    // registration there.
    const commandContainer = script.Parent.commands;
    registry.register(commandContainer);

    // If you've already loaded the command ModuleScripts
    // (e.g. through Flamework.addPaths) you can register
    // them like this:
    registry.registerCommands();

    // Type objects are registered like this:
    registry.registerType(someType);
    registry.registerTypes(someOtherType, anotherType);
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
`} />
