A command guard is simply a function that can be used to determine if a command
should be executed. You can use the `@Guard` decorator to assign guards to a command.

A guard function is passed the same `CommandInteraction` that will be passed to the command.
You can use this to access data such as the command path or executor, and you
can send a reply using its `reply` and `error` methods.

A guard function should return a `boolean`: `true` if the command should be executed,
`false` if not.
