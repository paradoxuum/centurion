<Aside>
If a response is sent in a guard (through reply or error), the command will not be executed.
</Aside>

A command guard is simply a function that can be used to determine if a command
should be executed. You can use the `@Guard` decorator to assign guards to a command.

A guard function is passed the same `CommandInteraction` that will be passed to the command.
You can use this to access data such as the command path or executor, and you
can send a reply using its `reply` and `error` methods.

A guard function should return a `boolean`: `true` if the command should be executed,
`false` if not.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
const isAdmin: CommandGuard = (interaction) => {
    if (interaction.executor.UserId !== 1) {
        interaction.error("Insufficient permission!");
        return false;
    }

    return true;
};

@Commander()
class KickCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "kick",
        description: "Kick a player",
        arguments: [
            {
                name: "player",
                description: "Player to kick",
                type: CommanderType.Player
            }
        ]
    })
    @Guard(isAdmin)
    kick(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {
		player.Kick("You have been kicked from the server.");
        interaction.reply(\`Successfully kicked \${player.Name}\`);
    }
}
`} />
