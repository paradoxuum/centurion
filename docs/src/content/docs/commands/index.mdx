Commands are functions that players can execute.
They're defined by their name and group and can have arguments.

A command does not necessarily have to belong to a group.
Groups are simply a way to organize your commands, effectively
turning them into subcommands.

If the command has arguments, the player's text input may be transformed into
a new value, which is then passed to the command function.
The argument's type handles this transformation.
