Groups are a way to organize your commands, effectively turning them into subcommands.

Groups must be defined in the `@Commander` decorator in order to be used.
You can use the `@Group` decorator to assign a command to a group.

For example, let's say you want to organize view and delete commands under a profile group:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Commander({
	groups: [
		{
			name: "profile",
			description: "Profile commands",
		},
	],
})
class ProfileCommand {
	@Command({
		name: "view",
		description: "Views a player's profile",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "The player",
				type: CommanderType.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	@Group("profile")
	view(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}

	@Command({
		name: "delete",
		description: "Deletes a player's profile",
		arguments: [
			{
				name: "player",
				description: "The player",
				type: CommanderType.Player,
			},
		],
	})
	@Group("profile")
	delete(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}
}
`} />

## Nested groups

Groups at the top level can have child group(s), whereas groups that have a parent
cannot have child groups. This limitation means the maximum nesting level is 2, as of now.

To define a group as a child of another group, you specify its name using the root key:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Commander({
	groups: [
		{
			name: "info",
			description: "View info about a user or the server",
		},
		{
			name: "user",
			description: "View info about a user",
			root: "info",
		},
		{
			name: "server",
			description: "View info about the server",
			root: "info",
		},
	],
})
class InfoCommand {
	@Command({
		name: "view",
        description: "View information about a player",
		arguments: [{ name: "player", description: "Player to view information for", type: CommanderType.Player }],
	})
	// If info was a global group, you could do @Group("user") here
	@Group("info", "user")
	userView(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}

	@Command({
		name: "view",
        description: "View information about the server",
	})
	@Group("info", "server")
	serverView(interaction: CommandInteraction, player: Player) {}
}
`} />
