## Enabling Shortcuts

Shortcuts can be enabled by adding `shortcutsEnabled: true` to your `CommanderClient` properties.

<Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderCline.start((registry) => {}, {
    shortcutsEnabled: true,
});`
}
/>

### Keybinds in UI

You can enable a terminal interface that displays a command's associated keybindings.

This interface can be enabled with:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
CommanderInterface.create({
    shortcuts: {
        showInSuggestions: true,
});
`} />

Note that this interface does not display context actions; you will need alternative methods to convey those behaviors.

## Using Shortcuts

<Aside type="caution">
Commands executed via keybinds do not accept parameters. Ensure your commands are structured accordingly.
</Aside>

Shortcuts provide a way to execute commands using key presses. They can be configured with single or multiple key combinations.


<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Commander
export class SayHiCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "sayhi",
        description: "Say hi!",
        shortcuts: [Enum.Keycode.H, [Enum.KeyCode.LeftAlt, Enum.KeyCode.J]]
    })
    run(ctx: CommandContext) {
        print('Hi ðŸ™‚!')
    }
}
`} />

In this example, the command executes when the user presses `H` or `LeftAlt + J`.

Note that `@Guard()` decorators still function correctly with shortcuts.

### Context Action Service

Commands can also interact with the ContextActionService, allowing them to run based on specific criteria, such as "PlayerInCar".

<Code lang="ts" code={`
@Commander
export class SayHiCommand {
    @Command({
        name: "sayhi",
        description: "Say hi!",
        shortcuts: [{ actionName: "WindowFocused", activations: [Enum.UserInputType.Focus] }]
    })
    run(ctx: CommandContext) {
        print('Hi ðŸ™‚!')
    }
}`}
/>

This modified example:

- Registers a command named sayhi.
- Binds this command to the window being focused.
- Prints "Hi ðŸ™‚!" when the user focuses the window.

Activations are optional. Commands can also be controlled via `ContextActionService.BindAction` outside of the commander.

For example, to unbind the `"WindowFocused"` behavior after a short period, you can use the following script:

<Code lang="ts" code={`
task.wait(5);
ContextActionService.UnbindAction("WindowFocused");
`}
/>
